## Motivation

This was an simple frontend project in the fulltime [Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/full-time/).

The aim was to use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to create an interactive application.  This was accomplished with the use javascript, with functionality organized into three domains:
  - single state object
    - stores application state in javascript variable instead of directly on the DOM
  - functions that modify and render state
    - changes state and updates the DOM
  - event listeners
    - responds to user actions, such as clicks or text input
